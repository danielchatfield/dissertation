### Card structure
 - Sectors, keys, access bits
 - Application Directory

### Security Problems
 - Research timeline
 - Practical implications

### Fixing
 - Sign the data
 - Backwards compatible
 - Spec is generalised

### But?
 - Raises barrier to cloning but still not impossible.
 - Can use counters to detect cloning and block card.
 - How do you block a card?
